# Virtual threads demo

This repository contains demo benchmarks showcasing different use cases for virtual threads.

- **Fibonacci**: how virtual threads are of no use in CPU bound tasks
- **HTTP**: how virtual threads improve performance in IO bound tasks
- **Sleep**: how virtual threads outperform platform threads when they have a chance to cooperate
